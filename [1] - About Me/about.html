	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Ashley. I'm married, have a dog and a cat and live in Chicago. My hobbies include going to concerts, playing video games, attempting to run, reading books and watching TV.</p>
	<p>I'm a visual designer and front end developer. Currently I work at Crate &amp; Barrel. I graduated from Bowling Green State University in 2011. Previously I worked at Coffey Communications and TrainSignal, but you can read more about that on my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>.</p>
	<p>I've lived all over the U.S. I was born in Canton, Ohio, then moved to Ovideo, Florida and then back to North Canton, Ohio in 1998. When I graduated high school in 2006 I moved to Bowling Green, Ohio to attend BGSU. After graduation I moved to Walla Walla, Washington for my job at Coffey Communications. Then in 2013 I moved to Arlington Heights, Illinois for my job at TrainSignal. After rocking that suburb life for 2 years, my husband and I moved to Chicago in 2015.</p>
	<p>I love to travel. My favorite trip was visiting England and Paris. My grandmother is from Ipswitch, England and when her grandchildren graduate from high school she and my grandfather take us to England to meet our family. In 2006 it was my turn. We spent five days in London, then traveled to Paris for three days. Then we traveled back to England and out to the country to meet my family. I can't wait till I'm able to travel more.</p>
